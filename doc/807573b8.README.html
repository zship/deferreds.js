<h1>Deferreds.js</h1>
<p>Deferreds.js is a utility library centered around working with <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A">Deferred
objects</a>. The main goal is to do for
Deferred objects what <a href="https://github.com/caolan/async">async.js</a> does for
Node-style asynchronous functions&mdash;that is, provide many common
higher-order functions (map, reduce, filter, etc.) accepting
potentially-asynchronous Deferred objects as arguments. These are located in
the <a href="#/Deferreds" title="">Deferreds</a> module.
