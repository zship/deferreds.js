Deferreds.js
============

Deferreds.js is a utility library centered around working with [Deferred
objects](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A). The main goal is to do for
Deferred objects what [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async) does for
Node-style asynchronous functions&mdash;that is, provide many common
higher-order functions (map, reduce, filter, etc.) accepting
potentially-asynchronous Deferred objects as arguments. These are located in
the {Deferreds} module.
